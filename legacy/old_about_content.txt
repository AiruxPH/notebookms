<h2>About Notebook Bar</h2>
<p>This app was made as a rather novel way to write digital notes. It uses elements from many of the popular
	note-taking apps and adds in a small twist that tries to emulate actually writing on a notebook. This is
	also reflected in the code where instead of a note being stored in one text file they are stored in a
	database.</p>
